- This is a top-down shooter programmed from scratch in GLFW/OpenGL.
- I wanted to learn about 3D graphics, so I figured a 2.5D game was a nice simple way to justify doing some 3D rendering.
- TODO what was involved
	- Learning about the graphics pipeline.
	- Rendering (shaders).
	- Collision detection. The game uses a quadtree as the first layer of collision detection, as all the is confined to a 2D plane. After than it uses full 3D collision.
	
	
- Testing whether the video embeds.
