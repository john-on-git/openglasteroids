- WIP readme.
- This is a top-down shooter programmed from scratch in GLFW/OpenGL.
- I wanted to learn about 3D graphics, so I figured a 2.5D game was a nice simple way to justify doing some 3D rendering.
- TODO what was involved.
	- Learning about the graphics pipeline.
	- Rendering (shaders).
	- Collision detection was implemented from scratch. The game uses a quadtree as the first layer of collision detection, as all the game objects are confined to a 2D plane. Afterwards, full 3D collision is performed.
